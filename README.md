# Portion of Screen
### Share a portion of your screen in Microsoft Teams or Google Meet
_Portion of Screen_ is a lightweight Windows application that enables you to share a part of your screen in video conferencing apps that only support full screen or just a single window.

#### Usage in Microsoft Teams
- Start _PortionOfScreen.exe_
- In a Teams meeting, select **Share** > **Window** > **Portion of Screen**.

_Portion of Screen_ version 1.2 supports two modes: 
- _Fixed Mode_: Only the area defined by the _Portion of Screen_ window will be shared. You can resize and move this window while presenting. Send the window to the background by left clicking it.
- _Focus Mode_: When Focus Mode is enabled, the window that currently has the focus will automatically be shared. Use this mode if you're regularly switching between windows.

The active mode can be selected using **System Menu** > **Options**.
 
#### Notes
- You (the presenter) won't see the _Portion of Screen_ window if it doesn't have the focus. However, your audience will see the _Portion of Screen_ window.
- You can send the _Portion of Screen_ window to the background by right clicking it.
- If you close the _Portion of Screen_ window, Teams will automatically stop sharing.
