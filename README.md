# Portion of Screen
### Share a portion of your screen in Microsoft Teams or Google Meet
_Portion of Screen_ is a lightweight Windows application that enables you to share a part of your screen in video conferencing apps that only support full screen or just a single window.

#### Usage in Microsoft Teams
- Start _PortionOfScreen.exe_ and position its window over the part of the screen that you want to share.
- In a Teams meeting, select **Share** > **Window** > **Portion of Screen**.
- You can resize and move the _Portion of Screen_ window while presenting.

#### Notes
- You (the presenter) won't see the _Portion of Screen_ window if it doesn't have the focus. However, your audience will see the _Portion of Screen_ window.
- You can send the _Portion of Screen_ window to the background by right clicking it.
- If you close the _Portion of Screen_ window, Teams will automatically stop sharing.
